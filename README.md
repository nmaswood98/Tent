## What is a tent? 

A tent is a digital area of a specified size at a location. 

If a user has entered a tent then any image captured will be part of the tent. A user can also draw message and send them into the tent. All users in a tent can view the images at a tent instantly. 

## Tent Owner 

The creator of a tent. 
Can delete any images in a tent. 
Can close a tent. 

## Dropping a tent

A user can drop a tent on their location.

## Entering a tent

A user can enter a existing tent from a 4 digit code or if it is a public tent. 

## Closing a Tent 

A tent owner can close a tent which would kick all users out of a tent. All photos in a tent will be deleted in the server

## Leaving a Tent

A tent can be leaved in the home page or by going outside of the tent bounds.

## Saving a Tent

Downloading all photos from a tent locally to a device. A tent owner will be able to save a tent whenever a tent closes. 

## Types of Tents

All Tents are based on location and size (radius). For example Times Square 2 mile radius. 

A tent can have multiple types if it makes sense. For example A Timed + Private tent. A Private + Public tent doesn't make sense so some types are incompatable with others. In general this list of types will decrease with generaility. 

### Public Tent 

Any one can join this tent. 

### Private Tent 

Users can join this tent using a 4 digit code. 


### Timed Tent 

The tent will be closed after a certain period of time. When the time is up the tent owner will have the opportunity to download any images or re open the tent. 

### Shared Tent 

The tent will stay in the location no matter if the owner is inside or not. 

### Owned Tent 

The owner completely owns the tent. If the owner leaves the tent the tent closes.

### Saveable Tent

If a tent closes all users have the opportunity to save the tent.
